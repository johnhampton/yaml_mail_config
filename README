= YAML Mail Config

YAML Mail Config moves ActionMailer configuration to a YAML file in your 
<tt>config/</tt> folder, just like your database definitions. 

To use, install the plugin, then create a <tt>config/email.yml</tt>
file that follows the sample pattern below, but populate with your actual
SMTP settings.

Sample:

  development:
    server: mail.domain.com
    port: 25
    domain: domain.com
    authentication: login
    username: email_account_login
    password: email_account_password
  production:
    server: mail.domain.com
    port: 25
    domain: domain.com
    authentication: login
    username: email_account_login
    password: email_account_password
  

Thanks to SÃ©bastien Grosjean (http://seb.box.re/) for the idea and the initial
codebase for this plugin!
